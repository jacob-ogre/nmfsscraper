Scrape ESA documents from the NMFS website
}
\details{
The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), along with the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), is responsible for implementing the
Endangered Species Act (ESA). There is a huge amount of information about
ESA-listed species and about how the ESA is implemented in tens of thousands
of PDFs that the Services host, but the Services don't make those documents
available from a single, central download location. This package is a (set
of) scrapers to search for PDFs on the NMFS website,
\url{http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov}, and download them locally to facilitate
analysis of the embedded information, e.g., using Natural Language Processing
(NLP).
}
\note{
\code{nmfsscraper} also includes a glossary of terms regularly used by
NMFS, from a document that can be easily scraped from their website.
The source site, \url{http://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/st4/documents/FishGlossary.pdf},
required some manual adjustments, and is included so users can easily access
the definitions but do not have to extract the glossary themselves.
